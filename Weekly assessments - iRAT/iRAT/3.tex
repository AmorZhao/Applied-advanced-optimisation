\subsection*{Question 1}
\textbf{Define the minimum element of a set S (according to Section 3.5).}


\subsection*{Question 2}
\textbf{Deﬁne the minimal element of a set S (according to Section 3.5).}


\subsection*{Question 3}
\textbf{onsider a circle and the cone $K = \mathbb{R}^2_+$. Sketch the circle and indicate all minimum and minimal elements in the ﬁgure, if any.}

\subsection*{Question 4}
\textbf{Give now the deﬁnitions of minimum and minimal elements of S with respect to a cone $K$ using the dual cone $K^*$ (according to Section 3.7).}

\subsection*{Question 5}
\textbf{Define a convex function in three different ways (1) Jensen's inequality, 2) the first order characterization, 3) the second order characterization).}


\subsection*{Question 6}
\textbf{Explain the meaning and importance of the statement: “the ﬁrst-order Taylor expansion at a point of a convex function is a global underestimator”.}
